# Code Style & Architecture Preferences

## Type Safety
- Never use `any`, `unknown`, or TypeScript type casting (`as` or angle bracket syntax)
- Use proper types and type inference instead
- Access data through proper type-safe methods (e.g., `liveData?.data?.property`)

## Database Design
- Use regular boolean fields instead of bitfield encoding/decoding
- Store settings in separate tables rather than embedding flags in main entities
- All database operations should flow through the database service layer
- Avoid direct Convex client access in tests or application code

## Testing
- Tests should work without `TestClock.adjust()` - LiveData should be available immediately after mutations
- Use LiveData properly: access data via `liveData?.data?.property` rather than casting or workarounds
- Tests should use the same patterns as production code (database service layer)
- Include tests in implementation plans and run them during development (`bun run test`)

## Code Quality
- Prefer explicit types and clear separation of concerns
- Avoid test-specific workarounds or shortcuts
- Keep test code clean and straightforward

Do not create summary documents or markdown documents unless instructed

Run commands with a timeout of 60 seconds unless instructed otherwise
